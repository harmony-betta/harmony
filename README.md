### Harmony Framework By Betta Dev Indonesia
Built with Slim Framework - Harmony Framework allows you to use Eloquent ORM, and Interact with your application via Harmony Tinker!

### Get Started

    composer create-project --prefer-dist harmony-betta/harmony project-name -vvv

### Install Harmony as Globally

when you install Harmony globally then you no longer need to repeat commands `create-project` composer.

    composer global require "harmony-betta/installer"

*Make sure to place the ~/.composer/vendor/bin directory in your PATH so the Harmony executable can be located by your system.*

if the installation is complete please type the command in your Terminal / Command Prompt as follows:

	harmony --version

Now you can install using Harmony Installer

	harmony new harmony-project

define the name of your project at the end of the command like `harmony new your-project-name`
